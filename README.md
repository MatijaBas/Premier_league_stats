# Premier League Stats Milestone 2
## Top 4 Premier League Clubs comparison

This project is made for all the football fans from one football fanatic. I wanted to help fans to compare last 12 seasons of 4 major premier league clubs.

The users of this page will be able to inspect how did they club do in wins, losses, goals and some finances.

## UX
The website is for individuals interested in football,with focus on Premier league, to be precise, on "grande four" teams of English football.
This project can help all the football fans to compare for example Liverpool vs Man Utd. or Chelsea vs Arsenal during last 12 seasons.
It's posible to compare teams trough couple of categories.

- As a user(read Liverpool suporter), I can compare my team with Chelsea team and see who scored more goals in 2009/2010 season.

### Mockup
- Please find paper and pen mockup for the first design [Here](Mockups/mockup.png)

**Note that the final design has changed from the original design in the mock-ups. I changed it because I was trying different layouts while
experimenting and learning the code and sometimes the new designs looked better than the original ones or was just more responsive. *

## Testing

### Validation

- Used https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/ in order to validate the CSS code.
  
### Features and testing
• The navbar was test on responsiveness and the reset button was changed to a fixed one to make it easier to reset.
• All the charts have been tested and they are working fine.
• The reset buttons was tested, they are reseting charts and graphs if you are click on it.
• Footer was tested together with two buttons in it and it's working.

### Additional testing
Used development tools in Google Chrome to check how the website would look in different devices. Also used it to try different style and ideas.  

### Problems and bugs:
- I have problem with table that contains all data, I tried to make table with 7 rows and columns and add a previous and next button.
I am unhappy because didn't made it how I originaly tought but the table that I made at the end is good aswell.
- There is still few problems with responsiveness because composite Chart is not responsive.
- Had a problem with data format, because it was season not one year.Fix it at the end.
- My mentor pointed out that some part of code was not formatted correctly with the Bootstrap divs and rows
    - To fix this I re watched some videos and took in what my mentor said to make my code clean and work more effectively

## Deployment
It is hosted by using GitHub, deployed directly from the master branch. The deployed site will update automatically upon new commits to the master branch.  
For the site to deploy correctly on GitHub pages, the landing page must be named index.html. I have run regular commits after every important update to the code, 
and I pushed the changes to GitHub pages. 
Once in a GITHUB repositories it was made live using GITHUB Pages. The website can be found at: https://matijabas.github.io/Premier_league_stats/
