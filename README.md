## UX
The website is for individuals interested in football,with focus on Premier league, to be precise, on "grande four" teams of English football.
This project can help all the football fans to compare for example Liverpool vs Man Utd. or Chelsea with Arsenal during last 12 seasons.
It's posible to compare teams trough the few categories.

- As a user(read Liverpool suporter), I can compare my team with Chelsea team and see who scored more goals in 2009/2010 season.
